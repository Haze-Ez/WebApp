Implementation of top-down parser
Please provide the derivation rules!
A The derivation rules should be of the following form:: A->aS
If there are multiple rules, separate them with enter!
After specifying all the rules, I am waiting for the end keyword!
S->T+S S->T T->a T->b end

Thank you!

Please provide the task to be solved!
b+a
This is on the left side: S S T T
This is on the right side: T+S T a b
This is the task to be solved: b+a
S alternatives: S1 = T+S. S2 = T.
T alternatives: T1 = a. T2 = b.

Derivation:

(q,1,#,S) (initial)
(q,1,S1,T+S) (S extension)
(q,1,S1T1,a+S) (T extension)
(b,1,S1T1,a+S) (unsuccessful input matching))
(q,1,S1T2,b+S) (backtrack in extension)
(q,2,S1T2b,+S) (successful input matching)
(q,3,S1T2b+,S) (successful input matching)
(q,3,S1T2b+S1,T+S) (S extension)

(q,3,S1T2b+S1T1,a+S) (T extension)
(q,4,S1T2b+S1T1a,+S) (successful input matching)
(b,4,S1T2b+S1T1a,+S) (unsuccessful input matching)
(b,3,S1T2b+S1T1,a+S) (backtrack in input)
(q,3,S1T2b+S1T2,b+S) (backtrack in the extension)
(b,3,S1T2b+S1,T+S) (backtrack in the extension)
(q,3,S1T2b+S2,T) (backtrack in the extension)
(q,3,S1T2b+S2T1,a) (T extension)
(q,4,S1T2b+S2T1a,#) (uccessful input matching)
(t,4,S1T2b+S2T1a,#) (successful analysis!)
