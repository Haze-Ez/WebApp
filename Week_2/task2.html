        <h2>A Penguin’s Guide to Romance</h2>
        <p>If you want to understand loyalty, patience, and dramatic gestures, don’t study humans. Study penguins.</p>
        <p>Take the majestic Emperor penguin. Romance in Antarctica isn’t about candlelight dinners. It’s about
            surviving -40°C winds together. Courtship begins with a call — a unique vocal signature that says, “Out of
            the entire frozen continent, I choose you.” If that’s not commitment, what is?</p>
        <p>Then comes the pebble proposal. In species like the Adélie penguin, males search for the smoothest, most
            perfect stone they can find. No diamond rings. Just a rock. But not just any rock — the rock. If she accepts
            it, they begin building a nest together. Romance, penguin-style, is practical: “Let’s construct a future.”
        </p>
        <p>And here’s the real flex — shared responsibility. When the female lays the egg, the male Emperor penguin
            balances it on his feet for weeks without eating, shielding it from lethal cold. No complaints. No “I’m
            tired.” Just silent endurance. That’s devotion.</p>
        <p>Penguin love isn’t flashy. It’s consistent. It’s showing up in blizzards. It’s recognizing each other’s voice
            in a colony of thousands. It’s choosing the same partner season after season — not because it’s easy, but
            because it works.</p>
        <p>Lesson from the ice: Find someone whose call you’d recognize in a storm. Bring them your best pebble. And
            when winter hits, stand your ground together.</p>
